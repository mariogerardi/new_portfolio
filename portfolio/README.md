# If you're reading this...

It means you've stumbled onto the GitHub page for the second version of my portfolio. Welcome!

## Notes:

This portfolio was built in React. Looking back, I would have made more reusable components. Although not entirely necessary, I believe it would have made debugging an easier process.

## Looking for the actual portfolio itself?

You can find that here: https://mario-gerardi-portfolio-v2.herokuapp.com/

### Thanks for stopping by. :)
